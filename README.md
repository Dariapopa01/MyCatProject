##Goal 


Create a command line application that saves a picture of a cat to disk. 


##Requirements 
    
- Retrieve a cat image from the following API:
https://cataas.com/  

- This API supports overlaying text on the image, a feature your program will make use of (see arguments section)
    
- We would like you to use C# as the language, but are flexible in your use of library, framework, etc. 
     
- Support two arguments: 


o  “-o output_filepath” : output file path to write the image to (required) 


o  “-t text_to_overlay” : text to be included in the downloaded image (optional**) 
   
- Cat image, including overlay text if specified, should be saved to location provided in the argument 


- Example 
  The program should be called like this:    
    - mySampleApp.exe -o “file.jpg” -t “I like cats” 


- Delivery
